    <!-- Chosen Palette: Wowhead (Charcoal, Blues, Golds) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a top-down exploratory journey. It starts with the high-level 'Design Philosophy' using a radar chart for a quick grasp of the changes. The user then navigates to the 'Professions Hub,' a central, icon-driven dashboard. Clicking a profession dynamically loads its detailed 'Artisan's Workshop' view. This structure was chosen to guide the user from the 'why' (philosophy) to the 'what' (the specific profession changes) in an intuitive, non-linear way, fostering exploration over a rigid, report-like structure. Interactive specialization trees with tooltips provide depth-on-demand, preventing information overload. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Core Design Principles. Goal: Compare original vs. redesigned focus. Viz: Radar Chart (Chart.js). Interaction: Hover tooltips. Justification: Provides a powerful visual comparison of multi-faceted concepts.
        - Report Info: All Profession Redesigns. Goal: Organize and allow detailed exploration. Viz: Interactive HTML/CSS Grid for the Hub, structured HTML/CSS for specialization trees. Interaction: Click icons to load details; hover on nodes for tooltips. Justification: Creates a clean, game-like interface.
        - Report Info: Inscription Glyphs. Goal: Present detailed, filterable data. Viz: Interactive HTML Table. Interaction: Filters (planned). Justification: A table is the clearest way to present structured data.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. All visuals are pure HTML/CSS/Tailwind or Canvas via Chart.js. -->
